		<h2>Trash</h2>
		<p>Putting trash in the right bins are easy and seems pretty obvious although there are many households which people put everything in the same bin and either dont understand or care what happens when you put your trash in the wrong bins.</p></article>
	

			<aside>I don't have a source for my own facts so this will be a place simply as a collection of facts and quotes I've found (and cited), in which Ive organized for easy access.</aside>

		<h2>Our Dying Oceans</h2>
		<p>Seaspiracy claims that fishing takes 2.7 trillion fish from oceans globally each year. If this rate of fishing continues, the oceans will be “virtually empty” by 2048, according to marine biologist Dr Sylvia Alice Earle.</p>
			<aside>"Our <u>Dying</u> Oceans" is not to be taken lightly. coral reeves are being robbed of their once beatiful bright flowy nature and their importance to their economy from changes in water temperature leaving them bleached white without life growing algae. Their ocean species who once relied on them left hopeless while the whole ecosystem crashes. There are many situations like this and its safe to say it's not the sun or nature causing this irregular amount of heat and dammage.</aside>
			<br><br>
	<p>Seaspiracy says that one of the greatest threats to our oceans is not from plastic straws
    - which make up about 0.03% of plastic entering our oceans- but fishing nets. <br>46% of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is Made Up of Fishing Nets. <br>
    Taking into account that the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is 1.5 million sq kms in size, 
    this is an astonishing amount of fishing nets left in our oceans.</p></article>
