		<h2>The Mission of this Website?</h2>
		<p>To make a Website which will give easy access to information about our ecosystems and sustaining them, aswell as other informarion about our earth.</p>
			<aside>A step toward making a change </aside>
            <p> the goal is for someone to have a change of perspective from this information like I once had. If we all get our heads together, and contribute, by spreading information and taking action ourselves it will certainly be worth it in the long run.</p>
